# model-trainer-app

Model Trainer is a web application built using Streamlit, a Python library for creating interactive web apps for machine learning and data science projects.

# Features

# Upload Data
This feature allows users to upload their CSV files containing the dataset they want to use for model training.

# Model Selection
Users can choose from various machine learning algorithms, including Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and SVM.

# Hyperparameter Tuning
Users can fine-tune the hyperparameters of the selected model using sliders provided in the user interface.

# Model Training
The selected model is trained on the uploaded dataset, and its performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC AUC score.

# Cross-Validation
Cross-validation is performed to assess the generalization performance of the trained model using k-fold cross-validation.

# Data Visualization
Users can explore their dataset visually using interactive histograms, bar charts, heatmaps, and scatter plots generated by Plotly and Seaborn libraries.

# Trained Model Download
Once the model is trained, users can download the trained model for future use or deployment.
